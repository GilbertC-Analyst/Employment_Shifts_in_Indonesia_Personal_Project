 Employment Trends Analysis in Indonesia (2020-2024)
This project analyzes employment trends in Indonesia over the past five years (2020-2024) across various job sectors. The goal is to identify key patterns, seasonal effects, correlations between industries, and long-term employment trends.

Project Overview
1. Data Preparation & Cleaning
Processed employment data from February & August for each year.
Handled date formatting issues (e.g., "2020 Agustus" to datetime format).
Checked for missing values and inconsistencies.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized employment distribution across industries.
Compared employment February vs. August to detect seasonality.
Identified growth trends and sector contributions over time.
3. Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
Tested Linear Regression to model employment growth.
Identified sectoral seasonality (e.g., Information & Communication, Health Services decline from February to August).
4. Correlation Analysis
Built a heatmap to analyze relationships between job sectors.
Found strong positive correlations (e.g., Retail & Transport, Mining & Manufacturing).
Discovered weak relationships (e.g., Finance vs. Communication).
